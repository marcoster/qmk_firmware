# mask keymap from/for marcoster for mask-v2 keyboard
This is my daily used keymap. A lot of inspiration was taken from sofle keyboard and the klor keyboard.

Features:
  - both layer switches are on one side (somehow I like this)
  - default layers in the following variants
    - QWERTY
    - QWERTY with homerow mods
    - COLEMAK
    - QWERTY gaming
      - layer switching on right half
      - space and enter on the left half
      - m on a thumb key (for the map in many games)
  - a lot (or all?) rgb modes enabled (the kb2040 has by far enough memory; but mostly just for fun)
